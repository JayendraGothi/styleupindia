    <h5>[A] Our Service: </h5>
    <p>To make your shopping more exiting we provide you with Cashback Service. To utilize this feature you need to register on our site and create an account with us. To earn cashback, you need to shop via our site; your purchases will be tracked by retailers on the site. For a Member to apply for cashback, the Retailer (from where you shopped) must confirm that the Member’s purchase is tracked, genuine and successful. Once your transaction is successful we must receive resulting cashback and a part of this amount will be credited as cashback to your account.<p>



    <p>We or our partners may offer new or additional services through the Site from time to time. Your use of those services may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which you must comply with. Those terms are notified to you on the Site in an appropriate manner when you agree to take those services, any failure by you to comply with a material provision of the terms governing those services will amount to a breach of this Agreement.</p>



    <h5>[B] Became a Member: </h5>
    <p>To be a member of cashback.styleupindia.com you need to register with us by providing correct information about yourself – including your name, address and other requested details. Also provide with bank account or Cheque payment details in which you wish to receive your cashback payment. All the mentioned details must be fully updated. We will be sending you all the important messages related to your purchase, cashback on your email address. Hence you always need to ensure that your email address is up-to-date and you have full access to it. If you change email address, then you must update it on site as we hold your Account details.</p>

    <p>Note that your Cashback Receipt Method (such as NEFT or Cheque) may have rules about the maximum or minimum payment that you can receive through that Cashback Receipt Method.</p>



    <h5>[C] Cashback Account:</h5>
    <p>After becoming a Member and shopping with us, you are eligible to withdraw your validated cashback when you have at least Rs 300 in your Account. In the event if the Member decides to close the Account with us or the Member’s Account is closed for any reason before reaching the initial limit, there might be a small transaction fee to withdraw the cashback. Cashback payments by Cheque carry an additional fee of Rs 30. This is charged by our Bank to cover administration and postage costs. We have the discretion to forfeit any such validated balance showing on your Account for the reasons provided elsewhere in this Agreement.<p>



    <h5>[D] Cashback Policies: (cashback and referral fees)</h5>

    <p>After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction, and once we have received the resulting Cashback for that Qualifying Transaction, we pass that Cashback to the Member through his/her Cashback Receipt Method.<p>


    <p>However there can be various circumstances in which a transaction with a Retailer may not constitute as Qualifying Transaction or Cashback may not result from it. The Member understands that all transactions made by him/her are not with us, but with the individual Retailer.</p>



    <p>From time to time Retailers may increase or decrease the commission paid to us, in such case the cashback offer illustrated on our Site may be incorrect. But we try to keep it accurate as far as possible. We shall not be liable for any difference in the expected cashback by the Member and the actual Cashback received by the Member.</p>



    <p>When we have traced a paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will credit your Account with a ‘pending payment’. Once the Retailer confirms the transaction, the payment will be marked as ‘validated’. This entire process may take 90 days or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are returned or the sale reversed or amended by any means then the cashback payment will not be made. Also if the Retailer feels that the purchase is not genuine for any reason whatsoever and we do not receive any Cashback for the transaction, then the Member will also not receive any Cashback.</p>



    <p>Whether a transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for cashback Transaction shall be at the sole discretion of the Retailer or us and the Member understands and agrees to the same. We shall not be held responsible if the Retailer fails to report a sale to us or does not qualify a transaction as Qualifying Transaction. Further, we shall not be responsible in the event due to some technical or other error we cannot trace a sale back to the Member and does not qualify the transaction as a Qualifying Transaction or a Qualifying Referral for any reason whatsoever. The Retailer or Retailer’s tracking agent is final; however we will try and recuperate missing commissions. At any point we reserve the right not to chase missing commission claims, particularly where no purchase has been made.</p>



    <p>When a Member sends us an enquiry on missing cashback, our system would check if the user had an exit click from our site for that store on the date mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks can be tracked then we will show a message to the Member indicating that they did not click via our website to earn cashback prior to the sale. All exit clicks to stores are saved in the database for cross reference on adding cashback values. Where a commission enquiry has been successfully paid by a Retailer, you may receive a lower amount than expected; this is due to the amounts received by ourselves possibly being lower than the original claim. We do allow you to query this with us. If a Retailer still hasn’t paid a manual commission claim after a period of six months then we reserve the right to close the enquiry claim.</p>



    <p>.We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance adjustments accordingly where it has been established that any credit has been applied in error. This will include but is not limited to transactions where the credit is not genuinely due or payment for any credited transaction has not been received from a Retailer or its agencies and/or misuse or fraud. This can include transactions which are already marked as payable or validated in your Account, or for transactions which have already been paid over to you by [BACS or Cheque] or any other means.</p>

    <p>There are various circumstances in which Cashback will not be payable to the Member, and will be forfeited to us, these could be, without limitation:</p>

    <p>Where the cashback payment that we receive is not attributed to a Qualifying Transaction or associated with an Account (such as where the Member is not logged-in to the our site when making the relevant purchase).
        The transaction to which the Cashback relates is cancelled after it has been entered into (whether under the right of cancellation that applies to some sales made at a distance or otherwise).
        The Cashback is attributed to a Member or Account that is suspended by us for any other reason or the Member is associated with any fraud activity or any breach of this Agreement.</p>


    <h5>[E] Execution of Cashback Services: (operation of cashback service)</h5>

    <p>We reserve the right to withdraw, modify or suspend aspects of the Cashback Service, or the entirety of it, where we have legal, security, technical or commercial reasons to do so. We will endeavour to give you 30 days advance notice before taking such action, except where it is necessary to take earlier action for security reasons or because of technical difficulties which would otherwise adversely affect our service. There may also be times when the Cashback Service becomes inaccessible as a result of technical difficulties experienced by us or on the Internet; we will, however, use reasonable skill and care to overcome these difficulties where they are within our control. Please note, however, that we cannot guarantee continuous access to the Cashback Service or any of the content that appears on it.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, we will strive to ensure that any periods of planned unavailability, which you will be informed of when you access the Cashback Service at the relevant time, are kept to a minimum.</p>
